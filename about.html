			<p>
				Hello there :) My name is Daniel James Hollasch but most people call me Dan or Hollasch. I am 25 years young, born and raised in (Central) New Jersey where I currently reside. My family is small,with one sister two years older than me. Shortly after I was born we moved into a home in Delaware Township where I would live for the next 24 years. In 2013 I graduated Hunterdon Central HS and started attending Rutgers University-New Brunswick the following fall.</p>
				<p>
During my time at Rutgers I studied in the School of Engineering and School of Arts & Sciences. I knew by the end of my freshman year I wanted to pursue a degree dealing with computer software or hardware.I studied on a computer engineering path to start, taking classes on electronic circuits and signals while learning the fundamentals of computer science. I eventually decided to obtain a computer science degree. I was lucky enough to have a full-time summer internship the last two years of college at a private small company CircuitWorks Inc. My responsibilities included automated testing and product quality assurance. I was offered a position of Software Engineer in May 2018. I parted ways with CircuitWorks in June 2019 after working on various projects including  vehicle integration projects and Android/iOS application deployment. 
To showcase my web development skills and my growing photography portfolio I created this website.
